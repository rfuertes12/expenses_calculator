# Monthly Expenses Tracker

This simple web app lets you track monthly bills and save them for future reference.

## Features
- Add, edit and remove expenses
- Save tables to history
- Export to CSV or print
- Sync history to GitHub for cloud backup
- Add reminders to Google Calendar

## Setup
1. Open `index.html` in any modern browser.
2. (Optional) To enable GitHub sync, generate a **personal access token** with `repo` scope from your GitHub account.
3. In the **Cloud Sync** tab, enter the token and repository name where data should be stored.

All data is saved locally in your browser. If GitHub sync is connected, tables are automatically uploaded whenever you save or delete them.
